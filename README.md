# **Ride Service Backend**

The **Ride Service Backend** is a **monolithic backend system** designed to facilitate smooth interaction between passengers and drivers in a ride-sharing environment. It supports features like **ride booking**, **location-based driver search**, and **real-time notifications**, ensuring an efficient and responsive user experience.

## üîß **Key Features**

### üë§ Passenger Module
- Search and view **nearby available drivers** using Redis GEO queries.
- Book rides through a simple and responsive API endpoint.
- Receive **real-time updates** for ride status changes (confirmed, cancelled, completed).

### üöó Driver Module
- Secure login and session management using **JWT** and **bcrypt**.
- Accept or reject **incoming ride requests** dynamically.
- Get **instant notifications** for new bookings and ride status via **WebSockets**.

## üß† **System Architecture Overview**

The application is organized as a **monolithic architecture** with modular components such as controllers, services, and routes.  
It leverages **WebSocket** for real-time communication and **Redis GEO** commands for location-based driver matching.

## üîÅ **Workflow Example: Ride Booking**

1. A **passenger sends a ride request**, including pickup location coordinates.
2. The system searches for **available drivers nearby** using **Redis GEO**.
3. Once a driver is found, the backend sends a **WebSocket notification** to the driver.
4. The **driver accepts** the ride, and both users receive real-time status updates.
5. The **ride information** is stored and tracked in **MongoDB**.

## üîí **Security & Authentication**

- **JWT** is used for stateless user authentication and route protection.
- **Bcrypt** is used for secure password hashing and storage.
- Auth middleware ensures route access control between **passengers** and **drivers**.
